This project contain a fresh installation of laravel 7 and Hubtel Merchant Account integration for Laravel 5
the package is available at https://github.com/jowusu837/laravel-hubtel-merchant-account

add your HUBTEL_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_ID and HUBTEL_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_SECRET into your .env file to complete the setup

also very important the package does not work with laravel 8 only 7 and downwards hence if you have installed laravel 8 or upwards,
you might need to downgrade if you wish to use Hubtel Merchant Account integration for Laravel 5 package
