This project contain a fresh installation of laravel 7 and Hubtel Merchant Account integration for Laravel 5.
The package is available at https://github.com/jowusu837/laravel-hubtel-merchant-account

add your <b>HUBTEL_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_ID</b> and <b>HUBTEL_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_SECRET</b> into your .env file to complete the setup

also very important the package does not work with laravel 8 only 7 and downwards hence if you have installed laravel 8 or upwards, you might need to downgrade if you wish to use Hubtel Merchant Account integration for Laravel 5 package
